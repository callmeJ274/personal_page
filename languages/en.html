        <p>
            English is the second language I'd learned. English is one of the subjects we had when I was a student. 
            I got one English Certificate of Merit when I was at my 5th grade. At that time, I really pasionated of studying English.
            But when I went to Secondary school, it turned out to be a nightmare to me. I did not have any notice about having English extra class since 
            I was only allowed to attend only 1 extra class, it was Maths. We had to study grammar which is the things I really hate.
            So my English got worse and worse and I turned to hate it at the end. I paied no attention to study English till I was at my last year in High School.
            I decided to learn English on my own and with my pace. No extra class, I learned from the Internet although it was really hard at the beginning.
            But at the end, I was really worth it. I got the English graduation score high enough for me get in to my dream university. Then, during my university years,
            I studied for the IELTS exam and I got the fruit with the 7.0 band. Thanks to English I graduated from the uni and got a job.
            However, as the English I've learned is in academic field, I'm still training myself to use English more fluently in daily conversation.
