          I've started to learn Korean since I was at my 9th grade. At that time, the catalyst of learning this language is by a Korean reality show Running Man.
          At the beginning, my house, I learned by a mobile phone with 3G Internet with the posts on Facebook. Later on, we had our 1st computer when I got into my High School, so my progress went quite good as everything is on the Internet.
          However, the 1 stumbling block I still have is the grammar and you may know that Korean has quite a complicated grammar. I was keeping the habit of learning Korean till I was 
          at my 2nd year university summer, I decided to get a Topik II. I printed all the past exams, did them and remember them, I watched video on Youtube, one of my favourite channels at that time and still now is Talk To Me In Korean.
          I learned a lot from them and at the end, I got Topik 4. It is just the exam to test my basic Korean skill, I think I will come back to take the exam again with my real confidence this year.
